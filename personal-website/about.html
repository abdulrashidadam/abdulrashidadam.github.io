  <p>
    I am an urban and regional planner whose research interests focus on the
    relationships between land use, transportation, and environmental systems,
    and their implications for the functioning of cities and regions. Planning
    is viewed as a technical and ethical process of balancing growth and equity,
    mobility and accessibility, and development and conservation of the
    environment. The underlying philosophy is that sustainable cities can only
    come about through planning, not by serendipity. Emphasis could simply be
    placed on planning’s impacts on access to basic services and, at large, on
    creating convenient and livable communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    My educational and professional experiences have given me a well-rounded,
    interdisciplinary approach to planning practices. I am currently pursuing
    a Master of Science in Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Iowa,
    with a focus on land use and environmental planning. I have appreciable
    knowledge of land use law and practices, environmental planning,
    transportation policy and planning, research methods, and spatial analysis
    using GIS systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, I am also involved in applied projects in the United States
    in a related field, including a comprehensive plan update for the City of
    West Branch, Iowa, which I am currently working on as my capstone project in
    a group. As part of this capstone project, I am currently serving as a
    co-editor for the comprehensive plan update group and as a liaison
    coordinating the interdisciplinary teams working on various aspects of the
    city, including the comprehensive plan, housing needs assessment, historic
    preservation plan, and capital improvements plan.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside the academic environment, I have professional experience in land use
    planning and design, mapping transportation networks and planning,
    environmental sustainability analysis, stakeholder engagement, and
    data-driven planning in both the public and consulting sectors. During my
    internship with the housing fellowship in Iowa City, I used my GIS and
    programming skills to enhance the organization’s operations by creating an
    efficient transportation routing web app. I also applied my programming and
    GIS skills to create a spatial component of their housing units that displays
    housing information using Leaflet.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my previous experience, I have worked with local governments and planning
    consulting firms, contributing to the establishment of spatial planning for
    city development, infrastructure mapping, and stakeholder engagement. In all
    aspects pertaining to data, planning, and stakeholder engagement, my goal is
    to be involved in open, participatory, and community-focused planning
    processes. I am actively seeking positions as a land use planner,
    environmental planner, transportation planner, and/or city planner.
